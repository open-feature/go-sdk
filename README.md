## üëã Hey there! Thanks for checking out the OpenFeature Go SDK

### What is OpenFeature?

[OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) is an open standard that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

### Why standardize feature flags?

Standardizing feature flags unifies tools and vendors behind a common interface, avoiding vendor lock-in at the code level.
It provides a framework for building extensions and integrations that can be shared across the community.

## üöÄ Usage

Before you get started, it's recommended to familiarize yourself with [OpenFeature's core concepts](https://openfeature.dev/docs/category/concepts).

To configure the SDK, you'll need to add a provider to the `openfeature` global singleton.
A full list of available providers can be found [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Go).
From there, you can generate a `Client` which is usable by your code.
While you'll likely want a provider for your specific backend, we've provided a `NoopProvider`, which simply returns the default passed in.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/pkg/openfeature"
)

func main() {
	openfeature.SetProvider(openfeature.NoopProvider{})
	client := openfeature.NewClient("app")
	value, err := client.BooleanValue(
		context.Background(), "v2_enabled", false, openfeature.EvaluationContext{},
	)
}
```

### Context-aware evaluation

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [`targeting`](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the `EvaluationContext`.

```go
// add a value to the global context
openfeature.SetEvaluationContext(openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
    "foo",
    map[string]interface{}{
        "myGlobalKey":  "myGlobalValue",
    },
))

// add a value to the client context
client := openfeature.NewClient("my-app")
client.SetEvaluationContext(openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
    "", 
    map[string]interface{}{
        "myGlobalKey":  "myGlobalValue",
    },
))

// add a value to the invocation context
evalCtx := openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
    "",
    map[string]interface{}{
        "myInvocationKey": "myInvocationValue",
    },
)
boolValue, err := client.BooleanValue("boolFlag", false, evalCtx)
```

### Providers

Many providers have already been created by a vendor or member of the OpenFeature community.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Go) for a complete list of available providers.

#### Setting a provider

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```go
// Replace MyProvider with the provider
openfeature.SetProvider(MyProvider{})
```

In some situations, it may be beneficial to registered multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more details below.

#### Developing a provider

If you can't find the provider you need, consider creating one.
To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider itself.
This can be accomplished by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```go
package provider

// MyFeatureProvider implements the FeatureProvider interface and provides functions for evaluating flags
type MyFeatureProvider struct{}

// Metadata returns the metadata of the provider
func (e MyFeatureProvider) Metadata() Metadata {
    return Metadata{Name: "MyFeatureProvider"}
}

// BooleanEvaluation returns a boolean flag
func (e MyFeatureProvider) BooleanEvaluation(flag string, defaultValue bool, evalCtx EvaluationContext) BoolResolutionDetail {
    // code to evaluate boolean
}

// StringEvaluation returns a string flag
func (e MyFeatureProvider) StringEvaluation(flag string, defaultValue string, evalCtx EvaluationContext) StringResolutionDetail {
    // code to evaluate string
}

// FloatEvaluation returns a float flag
func (e MyFeatureProvider) FloatEvaluation(flag string, defaultValue float64, evalCtx EvaluationContext) FloatResolutionDetail {
    // code to evaluate float
}

// IntEvaluation returns an int flag
func (e MyFeatureProvider) IntEvaluation(flag string, defaultValue int64, evalCtx EvaluationContext) IntResolutionDetail {
    // code to evaluate int
}

// ObjectEvaluation returns an object flag
func (e MyFeatureProvider) ObjectEvaluation(flag string, defaultValue interface{}, evalCtx EvaluationContext) ResolutionDetail {
    // code to evaluate object
}

// Hooks returns hooks
func (e MyFeatureProvider) Hooks() []Hook {
    // code to retrieve hooks
}
```

TODO: Extend the example to include initialize, ready, events, and shutdown.

> Built a new provider? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=provider&projects=&template=document-provider.yaml&title=%5BProvider%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!

### Hooks

Many hooks have already been created by member of the OpenFeature community.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Go) for a complete list of available hooks.

#### Registering a hook

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or invocation level.

```go
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
openfeature.AddHooks(ExampleGlobalHook{})

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
client := openfeature.NewClient("my-app")
client.AddHooks(ExampleClientHook{})

// add a hook for this evaluation only
value, err := client.BooleanValue(
    context.Background(), "boolFlag", false, openfeature.EvaluationContext{}, WithHooks(ExampleInvocationHook{}),
)
```

#### Developing a hook

Can't find what you're looking for?
Implement your own hook by conforming to the [Hook interface](./pkg/openfeature/hooks.go).
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.
To avoid defining empty functions make use of the `UnimplementedHook` struct (which already implements all the empty functions).

```go
type MyHook struct {
  openfeature.UnimplementedHook
}

// overrides UnimplementedHook's Error function
func (h MyHook) Error(hookContext openfeature.HookContext, err error, hookHints openfeature.HookHints) {
	log.Println(err)
}
```

> Built a new hook? [Let us know](https://github.com/open-feature/openfeature.dev/issues/new?assignees=&labels=hook&projects=&template=document-hook.yaml&title=%5BHook%5D%3A+) so we can add it to the docs!

### Logging

If not configured, the logger falls back to the standard Go log package at error level only.

In order to avoid coupling to any particular logging implementation the SDK uses the structured logging [logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr)
API. This allows integration to any package that implements the layer between their logger and this API.
Thankfully there are already [integration implementations](https://github.com/go-logr/logr#implementations-non-exhaustive)
for many of the popular logger packages.

```go
var l logr.Logger
l = integratedlogr.New() // replace with your chosen integrator

openfeature.SetLogger(l) // set the logger at global level

c := openfeature.NewClient("log").WithLogger(l) // set the logger at client level

```

[logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr) uses incremental verbosity levels (akin to named levels but in integer form).
The SDK logs `info` at level `0` and `debug` at level `1`. Errors are always logged.

### Named clients

Clients can be given a name.
A name is a logical identifier which can be used to associate clients with a particular provider. 
If a name has no associated provider, clients with that name use the global provider.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/pkg/openfeature"

...

// Registering the default provider
openfeature.SetProvider(NewLocalProvider())
// Registering a named provider
openfeature.SetNamedProvider("clientForCache", NewCachedProvider())

// A Client backed by default provider
clientWithDefault := openfeature.NewClient("")
// A Client backed by NewCachedProvider
clientForCache := openfeature.NewClient("clientForCache")
```

### Events

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/pkg/openfeature"

...
var readyHandlerCallback = func(details openfeature.EventDetails) {
    // callback implementation
}

// Global event handler
openfeature.AddHandler(openfeature.ProviderReady, &readyHandlerCallback)

...

var providerErrorCallback = func(details openfeature.EventDetails) {
    // callback implementation
}

client := openfeature.NewClient("clientName")

// Client event handler
client.AddHandler(openfeature.ProviderError, &providerErrorCallback)
```

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers.
This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/pkg/openfeature"

...

openfeature.Shutdown()
```
