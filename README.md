This is the Golang implementation of [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev), a vendor-agnostic abstraction library for evaluating feature flags.

We support multiple data types for flags (numbers, strings, booleans, objects) as well as hooks, which can alter the lifecycle of a flag evaluation.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/open-feature/golang-sdk
```

## Usage

To configure the sdk you'll need to add a provider to the `openfeature` global singleton. From there, you can generate a `Client` which is usable by your code.
While you'll likely want a provider for your specific backend, we've provided a `NoopProvider`, which simply returns the default passed in.
```golang
package main

import (
	"github.com/open-feature/golang-sdk/pkg/openfeature"
)

func main() {
	openfeature.SetProvider(openfeature.NoopProvider{})
	client := openfeature.GetClient("app")
	value, err := client.GetBooleanValue("v2_enabled", false, nil)
}
```

## Development

### Installation and Dependencies

Install dependencies with `go get ./...`

We value having as few runtime dependencies as possible. The addition of any dependencies requires careful consideration and review.

### Testing

Run tests with `make test`.

## Contacting us
We hold regular meetings which you can see [here](https://github.com/open-feature/community/#meetings-and-events).

We are also present in the `#openfeature` channel in the [CNCF slack](https://slack.cncf.io/).
