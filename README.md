[OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) is an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

<!-- x-hide-in-docs-end -->
## üöÄ Quick start

### Requirements

- Go 1.19+

### Install

```shell
go get github.com/open-feature/go-sdk
```

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "context"
    "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"
)

func main() {
    // Register your feature flag provider
    openfeature.SetProvider(openfeature.NoopProvider{})
    // Create a new client
    client := openfeature.NewClient("app")
    // Evaluate your feature flag
    v2Enabled, _ := client.BooleanValue(
        context.Background(), "v2_enabled", true, openfeature.EvaluationContext{},
    )
    // Use the returned flag value
    if v2Enabled {
        fmt.Println("v2 is enabled")
    }

### Providers

[Providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Go) for a complete list of available providers.
If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```go
openfeature.SetProvider(MyProvider{})
```

In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more details below.

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user, such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```go
// set a value to the global context
openfeature.SetEvaluationContext(openfeature.NewTargetlessEvaluationContext(
    map[string]interface{}{
        "region":  "us-east-1-iah-1a",
    },
))

// set a value to the client context
client := openfeature.NewClient("my-app")
client.SetEvaluationContext(openfeature.NewTargetlessEvaluationContext(
    map[string]interface{}{
        "version":  "1.4.6",
    },
))

// set a value to the invocation context
evalCtx := openfeature.NewEvaluationContext(
    "user-123",
    map[string]interface{}{
        "company": "Initech",
    },
)
boolValue, err := client.BooleanValue("boolFlag", false, evalCtx)
```


### Hooks

[Hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle
Look [here](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem/?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Hook&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=Go) for a complete list of available hooks.
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```go
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
openfeature.AddHooks(ExampleGlobalHook{})

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
client := openfeature.NewClient("my-app")
client.AddHooks(ExampleClientHook{})

// add a hook for this evaluation only
value, err := client.BooleanValue(
    context.Background(), "boolFlag", false, openfeature.EvaluationContext{}, WithHooks(ExampleInvocationHook{}),
)
```

### Logging

The standard Go log package is used by default to show error logs.
This can be overridden using the structured logging, [logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr) API, allowing integration to any package.
There are already [integration implementations](https://github.com/go-logr/logr#implementations-non-exhaustive) for many of the popular logger packages.

```go
var l logr.Logger
l = integratedlogr.New() // replace with your chosen integrator

openfeature.SetLogger(l) // set the logger at global level

c := openfeature.NewClient("log").WithLogger(l) // set the logger at client level
```

[logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr) uses incremental verbosity levels (akin to named levels but in integer form).
The SDK logs `info` at level `0` and `debug` at level `1`. Errors are always logged.

### Named clients

Clients can be given a name.
A name is a logical identifier which can be used to associate clients with a particular provider.
If a name has no associated provider, the global provider is used.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"

// Registering the default provider
openfeature.SetProvider(NewLocalProvider())
// Registering a named provider
openfeature.SetNamedProvider("clientForCache", NewCachedProvider())

// A Client backed by default provider
clientWithDefault := openfeature.NewClient("")
// A Client backed by NewCachedProvider
clientForCache := openfeature.NewClient("clientForCache")
```

### Eventing

Events allow you to react to state changes in the provider or underlying flag management system, such as flag definition changes, provider readiness, or error conditions.
Initialization events (`PROVIDER_READY` on success, `PROVIDER_ERROR` on failure) are dispatched for every provider.
Some providers support additional events, such as `PROVIDER_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED`.

Please refer to the documentation of the provider you're using to see what events are supported.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"

...
var readyHandlerCallback = func(details openfeature.EventDetails) {
    // callback implementation
}

// Global event handler
openfeature.AddHandler(openfeature.ProviderReady, &readyHandlerCallback)

...

var providerErrorCallback = func(details openfeature.EventDetails) {
    // callback implementation
}

client := openfeature.NewClient("clientName")

// Client event handler
client.AddHandler(openfeature.ProviderError, &providerErrorCallback)
```

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers.
This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```go
import "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"

openfeature.Shutdown()
```

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```go
package myfeatureprovider

import (
  "context"
  "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"
)

// MyFeatureProvider implements the FeatureProvider interface and provides functions for evaluating flags
type MyFeatureProvider struct{}

// Required: Methods below implements openfeature.FeatureProvider interface
// This is the core interface implementation required from a provider
// Metadata returns the metadata of the provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) Metadata() openfeature.Metadata {
  return openfeature.Metadata{
    Name: "MyFeatureProvider",
  }
}

// Hooks returns a collection of openfeature.Hook defined by this provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) Hooks() []openfeature.Hook {
  // Hooks that should be included with the provider
  return []openfeature.Hook{}
}
// BooleanEvaluation returns a boolean flag
func (i MyFeatureProvider) BooleanEvaluation(ctx context.Context, flag string, defaultValue bool, evalCtx openfeature.FlattenedContext) openfeature.BoolResolutionDetail {
  // code to evaluate boolean
}

// StringEvaluation returns a string flag
func (i MyFeatureProvider) StringEvaluation(ctx context.Context, flag string, defaultValue string, evalCtx openfeature.FlattenedContext) openfeature.StringResolutionDetail {
  // code to evaluate string
}

// FloatEvaluation returns a float flag
func (i MyFeatureProvider) FloatEvaluation(ctx context.Context, flag string, defaultValue float64, evalCtx openfeature.FlattenedContext) openfeature.FloatResolutionDetail {
  // code to evaluate float
}

// IntEvaluation returns an int flag
func (i MyFeatureProvider) IntEvaluation(ctx context.Context, flag string, defaultValue int64, evalCtx openfeature.FlattenedContext) openfeature.IntResolutionDetail {
  // code to evaluate int
}

// ObjectEvaluation returns an object flag
func (i MyFeatureProvider) ObjectEvaluation(ctx context.Context, flag string, defaultValue interface{}, evalCtx openfeature.FlattenedContext) openfeature.InterfaceResolutionDetail {
  // code to evaluate object
}

// Optional: openfeature.StateHandler implementation
// Providers can opt-in for initialization & shutdown behavior by implementing this interface

// Init holds initialization logic of the provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) Init(evaluationContext openfeature.EvaluationContext) error {
  // code to initialize your provider
}

// Status expose the status of the provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) Status() openfeature.State {
  // The state is typically set during initialization.
  return openfeature.ReadyState
}

// Shutdown define the shutdown operation of the provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) Shutdown() {
  // code to shutdown your provider
}

// Optional: openfeature.EventHandler implementation.
// Providers can opt-in for eventing support by implementing this interface

// EventChannel returns the event channel of this provider
func (i MyFeatureProvider) EventChannel() <-chan openfeature.Event {
  // expose event channel from this provider. SDK listen to this channel and invoke event handlers
}
```

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/go-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the [Hook interface](./pkg/openfeature/hooks.go).
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.
To avoid defining empty functions make use of the `UnimplementedHook` struct (which already implements all the empty functions).

```go
import (
  "context"
  "github.com/open-feature/go-sdk/openfeature"
)

type MyHook struct {
  openfeature.UnimplementedHook
}

// overrides UnimplementedHook's Error function
func (h MyHook) Error(context context.Context, hookContext openfeature.HookContext, err error, hookHints openfeature.HookHints) {
  // code that runs when there's an error during a flag evaluation
}
```
